== Spring Cloud Contract

You always need confidence when pushing new features into a new application or service in
a distributed system. To that end, this project provides support for consumer-driven
contracts and service schemas in Spring applications, covering a range of options for
writing tests, publishing them as assets, and asserting that a contract is kept by
producers and consumers -- for both HTTP and message-based interactions.
