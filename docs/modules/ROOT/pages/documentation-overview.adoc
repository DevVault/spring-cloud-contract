TIP: We talk about *Provider Contracts* when it is the producer of the API that defines the contracts and
publishes it for all its consumers to use. This approach is useful for producers that cannot
directly collaborate with their consumers -- for example, when there are too many consumers or
the consumers are external (do not work within the same company).

TIP: We use the term, *Consumer-Driven Contracts*, to refer to workflows where the consumers of an API
play a vital role in the process of creating the contracts. We recommended this approach, because it is easy
to implement when both producer and consumer teams work for the same organizations and the number
of consumers is not extremely large.
