== Contract DSL in Groovy


include::partial$_attributes.adoc[]

If you are not familiar with Groovy, do not worry. You can use Java syntax in the
Groovy DSL files as well.

If you decide to write the contract in Groovy, do not be alarmed if you have not used Groovy
before. Knowledge of the language is not really needed, as the Contract DSL uses only a
tiny subset of it (only literals, method calls, and closures). Also, the DSL is statically
typed, to make it programmer-readable without any knowledge of the DSL itself.

IMPORTANT: Remember that, inside the Groovy contract file, you have to provide the fully
qualified name to the `Contract` class and `make` static imports, such as
`org.springframework.cloud.spec.Contract.make { ... }`. You can also provide an import to
the `Contract` class (`import org.springframework.cloud.spec.Contract`) and then call
`Contract.make { ... }`.
