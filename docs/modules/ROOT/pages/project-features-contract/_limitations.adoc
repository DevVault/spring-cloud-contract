WARNING: The support for verifying the size of JSON arrays is experimental. If you want
to turn it on, set the value of the following system property to `true`:
`spring.cloud.contract.verifier.assert.size`. By default, this feature is set to `false`.
You can also set the `assertJsonSize` property in the plugin configuration.

WARNING: Because JSON structure can have any form, it can be impossible to parse it
properly when using the Groovy DSL and the `value(consumer(...), producer(...))` notation in `GString`. That
is why you should use the Groovy Map notation.
