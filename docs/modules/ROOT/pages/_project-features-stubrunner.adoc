= Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

One of the issues that you might encounter while using Spring Cloud Contract Verifier is
passing the generated WireMock JSON stubs from the server side to the client side (or to
various clients). The same takes place in terms of client-side generation for messaging.

Copying the JSON files and setting the client side for messaging manually is out of the
question. That is why we introduced Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner. It can
automatically download and run the stubs for you.
