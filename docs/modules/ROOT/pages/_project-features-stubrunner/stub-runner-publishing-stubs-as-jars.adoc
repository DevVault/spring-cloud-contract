= Publishing Stubs as JARs

The easiest approach to publishing stubs as jars is to centralize the way stubs are kept.
For example, you can keep them as jars in a Maven repository.

TIP: For both Maven and Gradle, the setup comes ready to work. However, you can customize
it if you want to.

The following example shows how to publish stubs as jars:

====
[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
<!-- First disable the default jar setup in the properties section -->
include:../:{samples_url}/producer_with_restdocs/pom.xml[tags=skip_jar,indent=0]

<!-- Next add the assembly plugin to your build -->
include:../:{samples_url}/producer_with_restdocs/pom.xml[tags=assembly,indent=0]

<!-- Finally setup your assembly. Below you can find the contents of src/main/assembly/stub.xml -->
include:../:{samples_url}/producer_with_restdocs/src/assembly/stub.xml[indent=0]
----

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
include:../:{plugins_path}/spring-cloud-contract-gradle-plugin/src/test/resources/functionalTest/scenarioProject/build.gradle[tags=jar_setup,indent=0]
