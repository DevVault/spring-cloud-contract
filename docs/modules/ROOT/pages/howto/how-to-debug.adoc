= How Can I Debug the Request/Response Being Sent by the Generated Tests Client?
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

The generated tests all boil down to RestAssured in some form or fashion. RestAssured
relies on the https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/[Apache HttpClient].
HttpClient has a facility called
https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/logging.html#Wire_Logging[wire logging],
which logs the entire request and response to HttpClient. Spring Boot has a logging
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/common-application-properties.html[common application property]
for doing this sort of thing. To use it, add it to your application properties, as follows:

====
[source,properties,indent=0]
----
logging.level.org.apache.http.wire=DEBUG
----
