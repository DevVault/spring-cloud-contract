= How Can I Use Stubs from a Location

If you want to fetch contracts or stubs from a given location without cloning a repository or fetching a JAR, use the `stubs://` protocol when providing the repository root argument for Stub Runner or the Spring Cloud Contract plugin. You can read more about this in <<project-features.adoc#features-stub-runner-stubs-protocol, this section>> of the documentation.
