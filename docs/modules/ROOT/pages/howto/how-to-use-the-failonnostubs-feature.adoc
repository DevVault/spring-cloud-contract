If you want Stub Runner not to fail if no stubs were found, switch the `generateStubs` property in the `@AutoConfigureStubRunner` annotation or call the `withFailOnNoStubs(false)` method on the JUnit Rule or Extension. You can read more about this in xref:../project-features-stubrunner/stub-runner-fail-on-no-stubs.adoc[this section] of the documentation.

If you want the plugins not to fail the build when no contracts were found, you can set the `failOnNoStubs` flag in Maven or call the `contractRepository { failOnNoStubs(false) }` closure in Gradle.
