= Why use Spring Cloud Contract?
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

Spring Cloud Contract works great in a polyglot environment. This project has a lot of
really interesting features. Quite a few of these features definitely make
Spring Cloud Contract Verifier stand out on the market of Consumer Driven Contract
(CDC) tooling. The most interesting features include the following:

- Ability to do CDC with messaging.
- Clear and easy to use, statically typed DSL.
- Ability to copy-paste your current JSON file to the contract and edit only its elements.
- Automatic generation of tests from the defined contract.
- Stub Runner functionality: The stubs are automatically downloaded at runtime from Nexus or Artifactory.
- Spring Cloud integration: No discovery service is needed for integration tests.
- Ability to add support for any language & framework through Docker.
